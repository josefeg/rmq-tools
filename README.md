# RMQ Utils

A set of utilities for working with RabbitMQ.
- `consumer.py`: consumes messages from RMQ and prints to the terminal
- `producer.py`: writes messages to RMQ from a template
- `delete_queues.py`: deletes all the queues

Make sure to `pipenv shell` before executing any of the scripts to switch to a virtual environment with all the dependencies installed.
